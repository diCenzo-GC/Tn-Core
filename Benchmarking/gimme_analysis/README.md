# gimme_analysis

This folder contains the scripts used to prepare for running the GIMME algorithm with the iGD1575 genome-scale metabolic model, scripts for running the GIMME algorithm, the extension to produce the final functional output model, and all output from running the scripts.

This code is dependent on the TIGER Toolbox (doi:  10.1186/1752-0509-5-147). It is therefore necessary to have downloaded and installed the TIGER Toolbox prior to running the code of this folder.
