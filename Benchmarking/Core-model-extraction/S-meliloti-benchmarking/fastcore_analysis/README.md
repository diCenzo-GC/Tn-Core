# FASTCORE analysis

This directory contains the pipeline for the FASTCORE-based extraction of a core metabolic model based on Tn-seq data, for comparison with Tn-Core.

This code uses the FASTCORE v1.0 (https://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstc/life_sciences_research_unit/research_areas/systems_biology/software/fastcore). Additionally, minNW uses the CPLEX solver, and it must therefore also be installed.
