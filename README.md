# Tn-Core

Tn-Core is Matlab toolbox for generation of gene-centric, context-specific core metabolic network reconstructions through integration of experimental Tn-seq and RNA-seq datasets.

The current version of the toolbox is version 1.0, and can be found in the folder Tn-Core-v1.0. Scripts used in the initial benchmarking of Tn-Core, along with the output data, are provided in the Benchmarking folder.
