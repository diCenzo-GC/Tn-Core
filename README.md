# Tn-Core

Tn-Core is Matlab toolbox for generation of gene-centric, context-specific core metabolic network reconstructions through integration of experimental Tn-seq and RNA-seq datasets. The most recent version of the toolbox is version 2.3, and can be found in the directory Tn-Core-v2.3.

Sample output data can be found in the Sample-Output-Data directory. Scripts used in the initial benchmarking of Tn-Core, along with the output data, are provided in the Benchmarking directory.
