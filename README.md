# Tn-Core

Tn-Core is Matlab toolbox for generation of gene-centric, context-specific core metabolic network reconstructions through integration of experimental Tn-seq and RNA-seq datasets. The current version of the toolbox is version 1.2, and can be found in the directory Tn-Core-v1.2.

Sample output data can be found in the Sample-Output-Data directory. Scripts used in the initial benchmarking of Tn-Core, along with the output data, are provided in the Benchmarking directory.
