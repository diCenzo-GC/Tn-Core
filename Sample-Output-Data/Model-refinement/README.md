# Model refinement

The Refinement_summary_table.txt file is a sample output summary table returned when running the function to refine a genome-scale metabolic model. This table was generated when refining the iGD1575 model without removing reactions producing dead-end metabolites. The Excel_models directory contains each of the models described below formatted as tables in Excel workbooks. The COBRA_models directory contains each of the models described below formatted as COBRA models in MATLAB files.

The following models are included in this data set:
- iGD1575_model: The starting version of the S. meliloti iGD1575 genome-scale metabolic model
- iGD1575_refined_model: The Tn-Core refined version of the iGD1575_model genome-scale metabolic model
- Draft_meliloti_model: A draft, fully automated S. meliloti genome-scale metabolic model prepared with KBase
- Draft_meliloti_refined_model: The Tn-Core refined version of the Draft_meliloti_model genome-scale metabolic model
