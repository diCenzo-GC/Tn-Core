# fastcore_analysis

This folder contains the scripts used to prepare for running the FASTCORE algorithm with the iGD1575 genome-scale metabolic model, scripts for running the FASTCORE algorithm, the extension to produce the final functional output model, and all output from running the scripts.

This code uses the FASTCORE algorithm distributed with the COBRA Toolbox (doi: 10.1038/protex.2011.234), and therefore no additional dependencies are required.
