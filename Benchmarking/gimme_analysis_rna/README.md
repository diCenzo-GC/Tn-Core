# gimme_analysis

This folder contains the pipeline for the GIMME-based extraction of a core metabolic model based on RNA-seq data, for comparison with Tn-Core.

This code is dependent on the TIGER Toolbox (doi:  10.1186/1752-0509-5-147). It is therefore necessary to have downloaded and installed the TIGER Toolbox prior to running the code of this folder.
