# minnw_analysis

This folder contains the scripts used to prepare for running the minNW algorithm with the iGD1575 genome-scale metabolic model, scripts for running the minNW algorithm, the extension to produce the final functional output model, and all output from running the scripts.

In order to replicate these simulations, it is necessary to download the minNW scripts (doi:  10.1186/s12859-016-1412-z), and place the scripts of the current folder in the same directory as the minNW scripts. Additionally, minNW uses the CPLEX solver, and it must therefore also be installed.
