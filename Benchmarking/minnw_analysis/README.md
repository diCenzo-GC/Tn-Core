# minnw_analysis

This folder contains the pipeline for the minNW-based extraction of a core metabolic model based on Tn-seq data, for comparison with Tn-Core.

In order to replicate these simulations, it is necessary to download the minNW scripts (doi:  10.1186/s12859-016-1412-z), and place the scripts of the current folder in the same directory as the minNW scripts. Additionally, minNW uses the CPLEX solver, and it must therefore also be installed.
