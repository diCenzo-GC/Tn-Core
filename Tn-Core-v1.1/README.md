# Tn-Core-v1.1

Tn-Core is a Matlab toolbox for generation of gene-centric, context-specific core metabolic network reconstructions through integration of experimental Tn-seq and RNA-seq datasets. Changes compared to version 1.0 can be found in the manual.

The toolbox currently contains eight functions written in Matlab for use with COBRA formatted metabolic models, and is dependent upon functions of the COBRA Toolbox.

To use the Tn-Core Toolbox, place all .m files of this repository within a directory included in the Matlab path. For a detailed description of each of the eight functions and their usage, please refer to the 'Tn-Core-manual.pdf' file.

A pre-print of the manuscript describing Tn-Core can be found at:
